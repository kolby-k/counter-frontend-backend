# Dual Counter Full-Stack Application

This project was for fun to practice full-stack development. It demonstrates the integration of a backend server with a frontend application through the implementation of two distinct counters: one managed on the backend using an Express.js server and another maintained on the frontend using React's `useState`.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js 
- **Backend**: Express.js
- **State Management**: React's `useState` for the frontend, server memory for backend
- **Runtime Environment**: Node.js
